        " I am a very determined, hardworking individual with an ability to solve problems and a skill to work with numbers obtained through a range of courses I had taken throughout the years. I am an alumnus of the Leaders' Quest programme offered by Life Choices, a part-time tutor at the IKamva Youth programme and currently enrolled to Life Choices Coding Academy for 12 months. As a result, I have been equipped with valuable experience in organising paperwork, administrating, leading, solving complex problems and mostly working with people through being a good communicator and a volunteer.My fascination with technology increased after I completed an information systems mandatory course at University of Cape Town.Through this, I am interested in enhancing my experience and skills professionally by securing a position in the service/tech industry.."
